Welcome and thank you for wanting to learn more about me. I am a recovering academic who worked on American institutions and public policy. I am currently a data scientist with NMDP.

In my non-academic life, I am interested in cheering for midwestern sports teams, exploring state parks, and watching PBS.

I can be reached at adam [at] adamolson.org and my X account is listed in bottom.
