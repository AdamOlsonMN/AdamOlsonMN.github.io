Welcome and thank you for wanting to learn more about me. I am a recovering academic who worked on American institutions and public policy. I am currently seeking more applied pursuits.

In my non-academic life, I am interested in cheering for midwestern sports teams, exploring state parks, and watching PBS.

I can be reached at olso4075 [at] umn.edu and my twitter account is listed in bottom.
