I've been working on some revisions to one of my dissertation chapters and I came across a chunk of the Congressional Record where a member of Congress is extending an anology offered by the bill's sponsor. The context is that this debate comes from 1938 where Congress is trying to enact the first federal minimum wage. The original House sponsor of the bill has died (House Labor Chairman William Conneley) and was replaced with House Chairwoman Mary Norton. So Norton is taking over working on this legislation despite it not it being her bill, originally. I think the rest is clear within the context.
