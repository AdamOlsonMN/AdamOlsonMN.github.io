Tonight I'll be leading a discussion / giving a short talk about the 2012 election.

Here is a [link](https://events.morris.umn.edu/event/asking_the_big_questions_7378#.V9hQJoYrKUk) to the event on the Morris website.

Here is the blurb from the event:

>Political science professor Adam Olson gives a brief talk titled "What's up with the Election?: Emerging Questions and Answers" that explores frequent questions and misconceptions surrounding this year's political process. Is Hillary Clinton really so hated in the country? How could Trump become the Republican nominee? What's at stake this election? What factors are influencing voters in the U.S. and elsewhere in the western world? Come find out and then discuss.
Asking the Big Questions is a campus/community discussion group that explores the significant issues of the day. It is sponsored by Briggs Library.

and here is a [link to the slides](https://github.com/AdamOlsonMN/BigQuestionsTalk/raw/master/Big%20Questions.pdf) I'll use.

If you're around, come check it out!
