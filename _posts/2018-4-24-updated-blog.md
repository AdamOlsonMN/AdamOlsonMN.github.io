title: Upgraded to a new Jekyl version
---

Hi everyone, I noticed my page css wasn't working anymore and updated the blog software to the newest version. While I haven't posted in a while, I expect a few new posts before the start of summer.

In the mean time, let's connect! I have extensive methodological experience and am looking for work. The links at the bottom of the page easily allow communication.
