[Here are the slides for my talk at SPSA this year.](http://adamolson.org/files/slides/AKOspsa2017.pdf)

The talk is about how the AFL-CIO split during the federal minimum wage debates during the New Deal was an extremly important and overlooked part of the creation of the bill (I talk about some other stuff too). The conventional wisdom is that the north/south split in Congressional Democrats was the most important consideration.
