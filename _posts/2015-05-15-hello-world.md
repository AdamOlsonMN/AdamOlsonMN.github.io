Welcome to my newly designed web page. 

As some of you may know, I used to have a blog and a landing page hosted on a traditional host. This proved to be a bit too bulky for someone who didn't need a lot of webspace and didn't really enjoy working with wordpress.

This new page combines a blog with a landing page and nearly everything compiles in markdown -- meaning that I can very easily write new stuff and update this thing. I'm using the [hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It was a snap to install and configure to my liking.

It also is based on github, which I've used a little, but that also facilitates very easy updating as well. It will also prove useful when I transition back into working on some quantitative papers -- which if you check out my [research page]({{ site.url }}/Research) should be starting up soon. One worthwhile benefit of storing statistical and other computationally intensive work on github, other than the facilitation of sharing, is naturally a version control platform and most folks seem to agree that version control is a necessary component of the modern scientific endeavor.

In the meantime, please do let me know if you see something breaking. ~~I realize I still have a few things to do including fixing the internal link directs and updating the DNS records.~~
