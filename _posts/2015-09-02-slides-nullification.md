[Here are the slides for my talk at APSA this year with coauthors Timothy Callaghan and Andrew Karch.](http://adamolson.org/files/slides/OCKapsa2015.pdf)

The talk is about the return of nullification to the states. Nearly every state had attempts to nullify federal laws introduced and many passed!

Please e-mail at olso4075 [at] umn.edu if you would like a copy of the paper.
