Just a quick administrative update. I'll be starting as a visiting assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, Morris in the fall. I'll be teaching three courses in the fall and two in the spring. In the fall I'll be teaching Introduction to American Government, Voting Behavior and Political Participation, and Introduction to Political Methodology. In the spring I'll be teaching an online section of intro and a course on the American Presidency. 

I'll be defending my dissertation in the coming weeks and will be on the job market again looking for more permenent employment. You can see the most updated copy of my CV [here](https://github.com/AdamOlsonMN/cv/raw/master/Adam_Olson_cv.pdf) (which is the same link as in the sidebar).
