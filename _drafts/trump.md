Nate Silver recently called Donald Trump ["the world's greatest troll."](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-the-worlds-greatest-troll/) He starts out the piece by writing:
>“A troll,” according to one definition, “is a person who sows discord … by starting arguments or upsetting people … with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.” The goal of the troll is to provoke a reaction by any means necessary. Trolls thrive in communities that are open and democratic (they wouldn’t be invited into a discussion otherwise) and which operate in presumed good faith (there need to be some standards of decorum to offend). Presidential nomination contests are highly susceptible to trolling, therefore.

By that logic, Trump is a troll. He might even be intentionally trolling -- I'm not sure. Regardless of his motivations, however, he has done an excellent job at controlling the agenda. He drives the conversation and seems to be driving it almost unilaterally. The "serious" candidates like Scott Walker and George Bush have been basically [ignored by even the most serious news outlets](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/republican-candidates-get-trumped-120444.html). While it might be bad for the Republican Party as a brand, it might be good for Trump if he wants to become the Republican nominee for President. Let me give two examples.

The first is that we know from [Jacobs and Shapiro](http://www.amazon.com/Politicians-Dont-Pander-Responsiveness-Communication/dp/0226389839) that politicians seek to drive public opinion towards the politician's preferred points. In other words, politicians construct public opinion to better facilitate their own electoral prospects. It seems entirely plausible to me that, even though he is viewed as a troll now, Trump's savaging of other candidates will continue to drive down non-Trump polling ratings and combined with Trump's monopoly on media coverage the other candidates will be unable to recover (though in some cases the lack of coverage to other candidates [may be helping them](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jeb-bush-medicare-phase-out)). The assumption by commentators so far has been that Trump is not serious about running for President *and that* he is hurting the "eventual" nominee. Well, maybe we should assume he is sincere about running and analyze his actions through that lens. Once we do that, we realize that the first step is to make sure he is the nominee and his strategy seems to be tearing down others. Ultimately, that strategy is working at this current juncture.

That leads me to the second example. The strategy I just ascribed to Trump reminds me of this section from *Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72* where Thompson recalls a story about how LBJ had started a rumor that his opponent "enjoyed carnal knowledge of his barnyard sows" because LBJ was afraid he was going to lose the election.

>The point, I think, was that in both the Ohio and Nebraska primaries, back to back, McGovern was confronted for the first time with the politics of the rabbit-punch and the groin-shot, and in both states he found himself dangerously vulnerable to this kind of thing. Dirty politics confused him. He was not ready for it—and especially from his fine old friend and neighbor, Hubert Humphrey. Toward the end of the Nebraska he was spending most of his public time explaining that he was Not for abortion on demand, Not for legalized Marijuana, Not for unconditional amnesty … and his staff was becoming more and more concerned that their man had been put completely on the defensive.

>This is one of the oldest and most effective tricks in politics. Every hack in the business has used it in times of trouble, and it has even been elevated to the level of political mythology in a story about one of Lyndon Johnson’s early campaigns in Texas. The race was close and Johnson was getting worried. Finally he told his campaign manager to start a massive rumor campaign about his opponent’s life-long habit of enjoying carnal knowledge of his own barnyard sows.

>“Christ, we can’t get a way calling him a pig-fucker,” the campaign manager protested. “Nobody’s going to believe a thing like that.”

>“I know,” Johnson replied. “But let’s make the sonofabitch deny it.”

The combination of controlling the conversation and ripping the other candidates evidently worked for future President Lyndon Johnson, why couldn't it work for (future President) Donald Trump?
