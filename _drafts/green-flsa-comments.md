I read an article today that said the AFL-CIO was getting ready to endorse Secretary Clinton after internal debate amongst the member unions prevented such an endorsement previously. 


Green thought that government labor protections would supplant collective bargaining, undermining the AFL's power. "With such objectives attained, it would mean that maximum hours in industry would be regulated either by the Government or by collective bargaining, with the Government withdrawing as collective bargaining expands, and with inducement to industry to accept collective bargaining as an alternative to Government regulation." pg 217


Green thought that a government wage floor interfiered unfairly with private enterprise. "Any such proposal to deal with the fiing of general minimum wage standards by a government fiat for men in private industry would be strenuously opposed by the American Federation of Labor as contrary to our conceptions of democracy, and as violating the cardinal principles of self government in private industry prevailing in this country." 219

His general sense was that only unorganized workers should be granted federal wage and hour protections and that once the workers become organized, those protections recede in favor of collective bargaining. 219-221
